## Full Stack Trivia

This is a trivia app that :

1) Displays questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Deletes questions.
3) Adds questions and requires that they include question and answer text.
4) Searches for questions based on a text query string.
5) Plays the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

## Development Setup

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)


## About the Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
